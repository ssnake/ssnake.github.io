My name is Max Nedelchev. I've been living in Sumy, Ukraine. 
I’m into programming since elementary school. I’m passionate about using scientific approaches to achieve goals. 
The idea that my work/apps will automate someone work makes me happy. I started developing commercial apps
 in the era of marshalling and keep doing this in the era of serialization. With huge luggage of experience in developing Delphi/ObjectPascal apps I’ve gradually switched to building SaaS products with RubyOnRails. Fascinated with blazing its gems I’ve created a couple of SaaS products that I hope will help people. 

I'm fond of morality, creativity, problem solving and lack of prejudice
